     <li> <p>Carbon credits aim to reduce GHG emissions by providing economic incentives for entities to invest in emission reduction projects. </p></li>
     <li> <p>These projects can include renewable energy installations, energy efficiency improvements, afforestation, and methane capture, among others.</p> </li>
      <li><p>By facilitating emission reductions, carbon credits contribute to the overall goal of reducing global GHG emissions. Carbon credits also play a role in offsetting emissions.</p>      </li>
      <li><p>Entities that are unable to meet their emission reduction targets can purchase carbon credits to offset their remaining emissions. This means they are effectively compensating for their own emissions by supporting projects that reduce or remove an equivalent amount of emissions elsewhere.</p></li>

     <li> <p>Offsetting can help achieve a net-zero emissions balance by ensuring that emissions reductions occur even if they can't be achieved internally.  </p></li>
     <li> <p>A crucial concept in carbon credits is additionality. Projects that generate carbon credits must demonstrate that they result in emissions reductions that would not have occurred otherwise. This means the projects must be additional to business-as-usual scenarios and go beyond what would have happened in the absence of the project.</p> </li>
      <li><p>Additionality ensures that the credits are genuinely contributing to emission reductions and not just claiming credit for activities that would have happened anyway.</p>      </li>
      <li><p>Rigorous carbon accounting and verification processes are essential for the credibility of carbon credits.</p></li>
      <li><p>Independent third-party organizations assess emission reduction projects to ensure they meet specific criteria and standards. These verifications provide confidence that the claimed emission reductions are accurate and legitimate, enhancing the integrity of the carbon credit system.Carbon credits operate within market mechanisms, such as compliance markets and voluntary markets. </p></li>

      <ul>
     <li> <p>Compliance markets are typically driven by regulatory requirements, where entities must purchase carbon credits to meet their emission reduction obligations. </p> </li>
      <li><p>Voluntary markets, on the other hand, cater to individuals and organizations voluntarily seeking to offset their emissions and demonstrate environmental responsibility.</p>      </li>
      <li><p>The sale and trading of carbon credits generate climate finance, which can be used to fund further emission reduction projects and sustainable development initiatives.</p></li>
      <li><p>Climate finance helps mobilize resources for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, supporting the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient future. </p></li>
      <li><p>Overall, carbon credits are a mechanism aimed at incentivizing emission reductions and promoting sustainable practices.</p></li>
      <li><p>While they have limitations and require careful implementation, they are an important tool in the broader climate change mitigationÂ strategy.</p></li>
