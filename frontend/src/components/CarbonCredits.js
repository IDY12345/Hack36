          credits and markets is to
          mitigate the growth of the
          concentration of greenhouse
          gas (GHC) in the
          environment. Carbon credits
          and carbon markets are a
          component of national and
          international attempts to save
          the Earth and Environment
          from pollution. There are
          also many companies that sell
          carbon credits to commercial
          and individual customers
          who are interested in
          lowering their carbon
          footprint on a voluntary
          basis.</p>
